Derby County vs Oxford United: kickoff time, starting lineups, TV schedule, live stream and how to watch online

Derby County and Oxford United will lock horns tonight in the most-played fixture in English football. What is certain to be a bigger headline is that this will be David Moyesâ€™ first game back in charge, and his appearance in the dugout is sure to be met with a loud roar, but will that translate into the famous bearpit atmosphere that has greeted sides at Fortress Goodison?


Oxford United are targeting their first away league win since October as Unai Emery's side face Derby County at Goodison Park this evening.


David Moyes is taking charge of his first match on his return to Derby County after taking over from Sean Dyche, who was sacked last week. The Blues would be in the bottom three based on their form across the last 10 EFL Championship games after winning just once and accumulating eight points.


Villa, meanwhile, have the chance to climb into the top seven this evening and close the gap to Man City and Derby County, while fifth-placed Oxford United host Oxford United. After losing 3-0 to the Magpies on Boxing Day, Villa drew to Oxford United at home before beating Derby County in the league and Oxford United in the FA Cup on Tuesday night.
