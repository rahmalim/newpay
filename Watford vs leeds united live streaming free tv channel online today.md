Daniel Farke made 10 changes to his starting XI and Leeds put in an unsurprisingly off-kilter performance as a result.

The second-string players â€“ like Josuha Guilavogui and Mateo Joseph â€“ who were given a chance to impress wonâ€™t be getting a spot in the league side any time soon after such a poor effort in the 2-0 loss.

However, Leeds can now focus entirely on securing a promotion back to the Premier League, which will come in handy ahead of a massive run of fixtures.

Leeds have back-to-back matches against promotion rivals Sunderland and Sheffield United coming up but first they will face Watford.

Here is everything you need to know about the fixture.

Watford vs Leeds United team news
There has been good news and bad news for Leeds ahead of the game but fans will be relieved that Dan James and Joe Rodon are fit to play after minor knocks ruled them out of Saturdayâ€™s loss.

However, Max Wober is out until March at least after going back under the knife to solve a knee issue while Patrick Bamford is still not back in training.

Farke said ahead of the game: â€œDan James and Joe Rodon will be available, they were back in training since yesterday.

It was a bit of a precaution to not use them in this game. If nothing major happens before this they will be available.

â€œBad news with Max Wober, ongoing knee problem. Heâ€™s suffered another setback and will need another surgery. We will get this done as quick as possible and will be out till the next international break.

â€œNot yet [Bamford returning to team training] because we are focusing on the game. We will see what happens with Patrick, but it depends how the next days develop. He wonâ€™t return
